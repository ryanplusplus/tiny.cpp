`tiny.cpp` is an embedded development library designed to be enjoyable to use, even in a heapless environment. Its components are designed to be flexible, reusable, and have RAM and ROM usage. `tiny` can be used bare metal, with an RTOS, or integrated into an existing framework like Arduino or Mbed and can be used on all but the smallest microcontrollers.

`tiny.cpp` is a C++ implementation of [`tiny`](https://github.com/ryanplusplus/tiny).
